title: Predicting Football Wins
---

This one post in a series of posts on data science projects.  The project name is "Predicting Football Wins" and focuses on web scraping, string manipulation, and using associative arrays to aggregate, format and use widely available football data to predict season wins.  You can check out my project [Predicting Football Wins](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Football%20Wins.pdf) presentation on GitHub.  This project employed advanced variable selection techniques and compared the relative power of multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model for football wins.
