title: Predicting CHF Readmissions
---

This is post 2 in a series of posts on data science projects. The project name is [Predicting CHF Readmissions](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/CHF_Readmissions/WilliamBaum1stCapstone.pdf) and focuses on data gleaned from chart reviews for a professional Quality Improvement project. This project included a process similar to measurement systems analysis [MSA] to review medical coding errors and employed a decision-tree model to predict 30-day readmissions for patients with congestive heart failure. As part of the project, I created a simple [dashboard](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/CHF_Readmissions/SimpleDashboard.png) to filter and explore CHF readmissions data over time.
