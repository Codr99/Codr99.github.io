title: CHF Readmissions
---

This is one of a series of posts on data science projects.  The project name is [Reducing CHF Readmissions](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/WilliamBaum1stCapstone.pdf) and focuses on data gleaned from chart reviews for a QI project.  This project included a process akin to measurement systems analysis [MSA] and employed a decision-tree predictive model to predict 30-day readmissions for patients with congestive heart failure.
