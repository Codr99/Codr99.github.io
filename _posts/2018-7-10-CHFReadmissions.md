title: CHF Readmissions
---

This one post in a series of posts on data science projects.  The project name is "Reducing CHF Readmissions" and focuses on data gleaned from chart reviews for a QI project.  You can check out my project [Reducing CHF Readmissions](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/WilliamBaum1stCapstone.pdf) presentation on GitHub.  This project included a process akin to measurement systems analysis [MSA] and employed a decision-tree predictive model to predict 30-day readmissions for patients with congestive heart failure.
