title: Metis - Project Luther
---

This is post 5 in a series of posts on data science projects. The Metis weeks 2 and 3 project name is [Luther](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Project_Luther/LetBusinessThrive.pdf) and focuses on web scraping and data aggregation from several websites, as well as the creation and comparison of multiple multiple linear regression techniques, with and without regularization (e.g. Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net). The goal of this individual project was to predict the best locations in the United States to start or move a business, as well as identifying key demographic and location characteristics that support a business success.  My final result identified the top US cities with populations greater than 10,000 with the optimal mix of low cost of living, low labor costs, and comparably large market opportunity.  This result is best applied to service industries that require geographical co-location.
