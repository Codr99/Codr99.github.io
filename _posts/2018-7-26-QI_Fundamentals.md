title: Fundamentals of Quality Improvement
---

This is post 6 in a series of posts on data science.  In my presentation, [Fundamentals of Quality Improvement](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Fundamentals_of_QI.pdf), I give an introduction to core quality management principles and share ideas gleaned from my experience as a quality improvement professional.  In doing so, I provide Data Scientists with a general framework to incorporate the soft skills necessary to apply Data Science to real-world problems in a multidisciplinary team setting.  I share lessons learned, and ways to avoid several all-too-common pitfalls in quality improvement work.
