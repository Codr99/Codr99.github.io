This is post 8 in a series of posts on data science projects. This project, entitled [Meat & Drink](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Project_McNulty/MeatAndDrink.pdf), focuses on creating and comparing multiple supervised models for classification, based on a datalake built by accessing and merging tables from multiple databases. The goal of this individual project was to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and proposal development for a new premium service for Instacart customers.  Through exploratory data analysis and model optimization, I successfully identified key product and client characteristics and opportunities to upsell Instacart products.  I suggest a dual approach to advertising, by adjusting the confusion matrix of the best model to boost recall for different categories of clients.  I also recommend an adjustment to the confusion matrix to account for advertising budgetary constraints.  My final results identified the most popular product pairs and factors that influence product repurchase.  I propose further study of advertising options through a designed experiment and confirmation trials.  Implementation of this service would increase Instacart's sales and improve the company's advertising return on investment, while offering customers a valuable new service.
