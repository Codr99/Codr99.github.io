title: A Tale of Two Nations
---

This is post 8 in a series of posts on data science.  In my presentation, [A Tale of Two Nations](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Project_Fletcher/Tale2Nations.pdf), I use unsupervised learning methods to explore Twitter text data regarding international politics between the United States and Russian Federation.  I completed preprocessing, lemmatization, tokenization, and weighting for both languages, and used multiple forms of topic modeling to compare and contrast the foci of public discourse among English and Russian speakers.
