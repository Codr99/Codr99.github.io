title: Predicting ICU Readmissions
---

This is post 3 in a series of posts on data science projects. My graduate capstone project for my Master of Science degree in Statistics is called [Predicting ICU Readmissions](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/ICU_Readmissions/WilliamBaumMStatProjectSlides.pdf). This IRB-approved observational study exhibits mastery of many data science skills, and includes: data aggregation, string splitting and manipulation, multiple rounds of data exploration, survival analysis, and the comparison of several machine learning algorithms to predict ICU readmissions. The optimal algorithm was then prepared for clinical use with applied logic, using a combination of my own subject matter knowledge and a review of the literature on chronic care management. This result offered an estimated 15% cost reduction in care management resources spent.
