title: Predicting ICU Readmissions
---

This is post 3 in a series of posts on data science projects.  The graduate capstone project name is [Predicting ICU Readmissions](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/WilliamBaumMStatProjectSlides.pdf)  and focuses on data aggregation, string splitting and manipulation, multiple rounds of data exploration, survival analysis, and the comparison of several machine learning algorithms to predict ICU readmissions.  The optimal algorithm was then prepared to put into production with applied logic, using a combination of my own subject matter knowledge and review of the literature on chronic care management.  This result offered an estimated 15% cost reduction in care management hours.  The first few slides are a natural extension of a separate graduate degree capstone project, but the analysis layers are greatly expanded, more comprehensive, and apply to different, much larger populations.
