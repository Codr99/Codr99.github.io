title: Metis - Project Benson
---

This is my first post in a series of posts on data science projects.  The Metis project name is "Benson" and focuses on munging and building insights on MTA turnstile data for New York City's subways.  You can check out my group's [Project Benson](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Metis_mta_pit_crew.pdf) presentation on GitHub.  This project involved a great deal of data munging, outlier analysis, and data exploration.  I also added desirability functions in python to conduct multiple response optimization to minimize reduction in ticket sales and minimize number of riders affected by station closures.
