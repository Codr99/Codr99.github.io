title: Metis - Project Benson
---

This one post in a series of posts on data science projects.  The Metis project name is [Benson](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Metis_mta_pit_crew.pdf) and focuses on munging and building insights on MTA turnstile data for New York City's subways.  This project involved a great deal of data munging, outlier analysis, and data exploration.  I also added desirability functions in python to conduct multiple response optimization to minimize reduction in ticket sales and minimize number of riders affected by station closures.
