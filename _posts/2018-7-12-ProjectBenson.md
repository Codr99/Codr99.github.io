title: MTA Pit Crew
---

This is post 4 in a series of posts on data science projects. The project, entitled [MTA Pit Crew](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Project_Benson/Metis_mta_pit_crew.pdf) analyzed the optimal planned repair schedule for Subway repairs for New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority.  The Metis week 1 project focuses on complex data munging and building insights on MTA turnstile data for New York City's subways. This group project included a large amount of string manipulation, outlier analysis, and data exploration. One of my contributions was the addition of desirability functions, in Python, to conduct multiple response optimization.  This both minimized reduction in ticket sales, and minimizized number of riders affected by station closures.
