title: Metis - Project Benson
---

This is one in a series of posts on data science projects.  The Metis week 1 project name is [Benson](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/Metis_mta_pit_crew.pdf) and focuses on munging and building insights on MTA turnstile data for New York City's subways.  This group project involved a great deal of data munging, outlier analysis, and data exploration.  One of my contributions was the addition of desirability functions in python to conduct multiple response optimization to minimize reduction in ticket sales and minimize number of riders affected by station closures.
