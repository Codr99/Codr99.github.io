title: A Sigh of Relief
---

This is post 10 in a series of posts on data science.  In my project, [A Sigh of Relief](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/SighRelief.pdf), I focused on development of a deep learning model to diagnose and map areas of pneumonia in Chest X-rays. XML data was extracted from dicom files and images were processed. The resulting data was ported to Amazon Web Services [AWS], where a predictive model was built with Keras and Tensor Flow to identify areas with consolidation and diagnose pneumonia.
