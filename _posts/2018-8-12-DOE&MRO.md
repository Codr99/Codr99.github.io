title: Design of Experiments & Multiple Response Optimization
---

This is post 8 in a series of posts on data science.  In my presentation, [Design of Experiments & Multiple Response Optimization](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/DOE%26MRO.pdf), I give an introduction to the concepts of Design of Experiments [DOE] and Multiple Response Optimization [MRO].  In doing so, I identify the benefits of DOE for conducting efficient, prospective multivariate testing, and the use of MRO when the need arises to optimize multiple outcomes, simultaneously.
