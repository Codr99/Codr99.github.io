title: Design of Experiments & Multiple Response Optimization
---

This is post 7 in a series of posts on data science.  In my presentation, [Design of Experiments & Multiple Response Optimization](https://github.com/Codr99/Portfolio/blob/master/DOE%26MRO.pdf), I give an introduction to the concepts of Design of Experiments [DOE] and Multiple Response Optimization [MRO].  In doing so, I identify the benefits of DOE and MRO to Data Scientists, both in terms of a system of conducting efficient, prospective multivariate testing and optimization, respectfully.
